<h2>demo; experiments in graphics</h2>
<p>I've always adored games, they were the place I discovered CS and are still the place I retreat to. I wanted to find out
how they work. Here's a chronological dev-log of my efforts.</p>

<div><a href="./gibson.html" alt="Gibson">Gibson</a><p>I pretty much wanted to emulate that scene from hackers where they
show the search of the .garbage files within the Gibson, so I created a shit-ton of columns and thought this was pretty
blackhat. Turns out lighting and mesh composition have an effect on performance...<br/> <br/> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>
<hr/>

<div><a href="./square.html" alt="Square">Square</a><p>It took me forever to figure out moving those columns around the
camera alongside rotation, and to be honest I never figured out a better way than 'syncing' at the end of every action.
I wanted to get this pixel-perfect so that it would loop smoothly, which I failed in. I was still super proud of getting
this far though.</p></div>
<hr/>

<div><a href="./murj.html" alt="Murj">Murj</a><p>I somehow won a fb hackathon in London - the prize of which was an Oculus Quest,
    so this was my attempt at progressing on gibson and adding VR-compatibility, so I could send a nauseating demo to my team to
    f*ck with them ❤</p></div>
<hr/>

<div><a href="./gr1d.html" alt="Grid 1">gr1d</a><p>There was quite a time lapse between square and gr1d, as I hit a road block
with loading in and out geometries, understanding how you could do that without it looking janky. I also moved to Sweden.
    Both the result of this and my move were happy, accidental outcomes.</p></div>
<hr/>

<div><a href="./gr2d.html" alt="Grid 2">gr2d</a><p>I took this concept a little further and made it semi-functional. Still trying
to figure out timing loops but I think Three.JS probably isn't the place for that anyway. I had fun with this, and it's working alright.
